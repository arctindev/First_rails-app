Things i learned:

- to show routes list : rails routes
- to create working model with form snippets : rails g scaffold (model name) (table name):(table type) (table name):(table type)
- to push migration : rails db:migrate
- to render patrial : <%= render (patrial route) %>
- conditional rendering in ruby :
